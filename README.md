## Introduction

Bridges represent critical infrastructure components, serving as fundamental transportation facilities that traverse various landscapes. They hold substantial significance in the domains like civil transportation and disaster relief efforts. To ensure the visibility and integrity of bridges, it is essential to perform **holistic bridge detection in large-size very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images (RSIs)**. 

However, large-scale datasets and methods suitable for holistic bridge detection in large-sisze RSIs have yet to be explored. This work aims to addresses the challenge of **holistic bridge detection** in large-size VHR RSIs. Key contributions include:
- **GLH-Bridge**: A large-scale dataset with 6,000 globally sampled VHR images (from 2,048 x 2,048 to 16,384 x 16,384 pixels) and 59,737 manually annotated bridges.
- **HBD-Net**: A novel method for holistic bridge detection.
- Comprehensive benchmarks for both Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) and Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) tasks.

## GLH-Bridge Dataset
### Key Features
🌍 **Diverse Coverage**  
6,000 images spanning global geographic locations with varied backgrounds (vegetation, riverbeds, roads).

🖼️ **Very-High-Resolution**  
Image sizes range from 2,048×2,048 to 16,384×16,384 pixels.

📊 **Rich Annotations**  
59,737 bridges annotated with both OBB and HBB labels, featuring:
- Extreme aspect ratios
- Multi-scale instances
- Varied instance densities

## Code


Please employ the following scripts for training and inference:

- **Training**:
  - Multi-resolution data splitting: [`tools/split_code.py`](./tools/split_code.py)
